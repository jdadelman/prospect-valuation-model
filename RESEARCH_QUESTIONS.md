# Research Questions

## Framing
This project treats prospect FV as an asset-valuation proxy, not ground-truth performance.

## Primary Question
Can explicit multimodal aggregation of publicly available prospect information improve valuation quality versus implicit human aggregation?

## Admissible Improvements
- Lower variance conditional on inputs
- Better calibration of FV transitions
- Stronger neighborhood coherence

## Out of Scope
- Predicting MLB WAR as a primary objective
- Claims of information advantage over human evaluators
